# simple-sql-parser

A parser for SQL queries in Haskell. Also includes a pretty printer
which formats output nicely. The first goal is to parse most of
SQL:2003 queries, and also some other SQL dialects.

This is the documentation for version 0.2.0.

Status: Covers a lot of queries already and is mostly stable. There is
a small showstopper in the precedence and associativity handling of
operators, which has some minor issues but mostly works fine. This bug
doesn't affect regular binary symbol operators such as comparison
operators (==, <=, etc,) and arithmetic operators (+,-, etc.).

Tested with GHC 7.6.3.

# Feature support

* select lists
* from clause
* where clause
* group by clause
* having clause
* order by clause
* offset and fetch
* set operators
* common table expressions
* wide range of scalar expressions

See the [supported_sql.html](supported_sql.html) page for details on
the supported SQL.

Here is a document with all the [simple-sql-parser test
cases](test_cases.html) rendered in a webpage so you can get an idea
of what it supports.
