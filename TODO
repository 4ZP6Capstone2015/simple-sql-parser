----

Later general tasks:

dialect switching

refactor the join parsing

left factor parsing code in remaining places

reimplement the fixity thing natively

fix lexing wrt suffixes 1/2 done

position annotation?


= sql support

scalar function syntax:

  review all ansi sql operators
  placeholder/positional arg

other missing operators
  row constructors -> needed for stuff like
  'where (a,b) = any (select a,b from t)'


review allowed identifier syntax
  add quoted identifers
more dots in identifiers
order by nulls first/last
extend case
escapes in string literals
full number literals -> other bases?
group by (), grouping sets(), cube, rollup
lateral
named windows
table, values
apply, pivot
collate
within group aggregate syntax

support the ansi version for limit and offset, plus review other
   dialects

try to do full review of sql2003 query syntax

make ansi dialect which only supports ansi sql. Maybe there is a use
   for a separate SQL 92, 99 and 2003 dialects?

other dialect targets:
postgres
oracle
teradata
ms sql server
mysql?
db2?

maybe later: other dml
